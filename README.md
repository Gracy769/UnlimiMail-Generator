## 1. Plus Addressing ($\text{+}$ Addressing)

This is the **most powerful method** for **tracking** and **filtering** email sources.

### How to Use

Simply add a plus sign (`+`) followed by any tag (word or number) *before* the `@gmail.com` part of your address.

| Your Real Email | Alias Example | Filter Key |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `johndoe@gmail.com` | `johndoe**+netflix**@gmail.com` | **`+netflix`** |
| `johndoe@gmail.com` | `johndoe**+spam-source-7**@gmail.com` | **`+spam-source-7`** |

### Setting Up Filters

1.  In Gmail, click the **'Show search options'** arrow in the search bar.
2.  In the **"To"** field, enter the alias tag (e.g., `johndoe+netflix@gmail.com`).
3.  Click **"Create filter"** and choose your action:
    * **Delete it** (for known spam sources)
    * **Apply the label** (for organization)
    * **Skip the Inbox (Archive)** (for newsletters)

## 2. The Dot Trick

This method is primarily useful for bypassing website validation that restricts multiple accounts to one email address.

### How to Use

Gmail **ignores dots** (`.`) anywhere in the username. Any combination of dots will still deliver to your main address.

| Your Real Email | Alias Example | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `johndoe@gmail.com` | `john.doe@gmail.com` | Secondary account signup |
| `johndoe@gmail.com` | `j.o.h.n.d.o.e@gmail.com` | Unlimited variations |

**No setup is required!** Emails sent to any dot-variant simply arrive in your primary inbox.
